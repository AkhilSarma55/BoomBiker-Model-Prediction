Boombikes-LinearRegression-Assignment

Linear Regression performed on the Boombikes bike rental dataset as part of an assignment for coursework in the course Executive PG in Machine Learning and AI from IIIT Bangalore.

A)Note :

Run the jupyter notebook line by line

General Information:

1.Multiple linear regression is performed on the dataset.

2.The project is done as part of coursework in the Machine Learning module.

3.We are trying to find the number of rentals issued from the company based on numerous independent values such as temperature, weather, humidity, holiday, etc.

4.The Boombikes bike rental dataset is being used.

B)Conclusion:

Significant variables to predict the demand for shared bikes

1.holiday

2.temp

3.hum

4.windspeed

5.Season

6.months(January, July, September, November, December)

7.Year (2019)

8.Sunday

9.weathersit( Light Snow, Mist + Cloudy)

C)Recommendations:

1.These interpretations help us derive meaningful insights in the bike rental market and the behaviour of the people.

2.One of the recommendations based on this model are that there should be aggressive marketing in the summer and spring season to drive up rentals.

3.Since the summer months also show low rental levels, a strong marketing strategy for the first 6 months of the year can assist in driving up the rental numbers.

4.There has to be an approach required to introduce more users on days where the weather is less clear, perhaps with incentives or strategic deals.

5.Rentals were more in 2019 than 2018 which suggests that over time more people would be exposed to this idea and there has to a strong analysis done to retain the repeat customers.

D)Technologies Used:

1.pandas

2.seaborn

3.matplotlib

4.statsmodels

5.sci-kit learn

6.numpy
